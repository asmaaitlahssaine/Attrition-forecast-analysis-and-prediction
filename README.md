# Attrition Forecast: Analysis and Prediction

This project, completed during my internship at Technocolabs Softwares, centers on analyzing employee attrition and key metrics related to career development. The analysis aims to identify areas for improvement in employee retention and propose actionable strategies to support career advancement within the organization.

## Project Overview

Employee attrition and career development are closely linked aspects of organizational health. In this project, I focused on understanding the factors influencing employee turnover and examining key career development metrics to propose strategies for enhancing employee growth opportunities. The project relies on Business Intelligence (BI) tools to analyze historical data and visualize trends, offering insights that can guide HR decisions.

## Key Components

### 1. **Business Intelligence (BI) Analysis**

The BI analysis was divided into several key tasks aimed at understanding career development within the organization:

#### a. **Years at Company**
- **Objective**: Analyze the average number of years employees have been with the company to identify trends and discrepancies across departments or employee groups.
- **KPI**: **Average Years at Company** - This measures employee loyalty and retention, while also helping to identify whether there are sufficient growth and advancement opportunities.

#### b. **Years in Current Role**
- **Objective**: Evaluate the average tenure of employees in their current roles, looking for patterns or correlations with job satisfaction or performance.
- **KPI**: **Average Years in Current Role** - A higher average might indicate potential issues with career progression or a lack of advancement opportunities within the organization.

#### c. **Years Since Last Promotion**
- **Objective**: Review how long it has been since employees were last promoted, identifying departments or roles where promotions are infrequent.
- **KPI**: **Average Years Since Last Promotion** - This helps assess whether the promotion process is effective and whether there are sufficient advancement opportunities, impacting employee morale and retention.

#### d. **Distribution of Education Levels**
- **Objective**: Explore the distribution of education levels among employees and determine correlations between educational background and career advancement.
- **KPI**: **Distribution of Education Levels** - Understanding the educational diversity within the organization can inform development programs and career advancement strategies.

### 2. **Career Development Insights and Strategies**

Based on the analysis of these KPIs, I identified several areas for improvement and proposed strategies to enhance career development:

- **Areas for Improvement**: The analysis revealed departments with stagnant career progression and roles where employees have not been promoted for extended periods. Additionally, there were disparities in career advancement opportunities across different education levels.
  
- **Proposed Strategies**:
  - **Improving Promotion Processes**: Streamline and make the promotion process more transparent to ensure deserving employees are recognized and advanced in a timely manner.
  - **Providing Training and Development Opportunities**: Implement continuous learning programs and career development workshops to equip employees with the skills needed for advancement.
  - **Fostering a Culture of Continuous Learning**: Encourage a learning culture within the organization that values growth, adaptability, and skill enhancement.
